//  We have been waiting for you to arrive so you can carry out this vital mission! Based on your qualifications and prior experience we know you are the best fit for this mission. We fear that the Martians are planning an attack on Earth to steal our technology for instant mashed potatoes as they will use it to power their death ray that could end all life as we know it. I know it sounds strange, hell, I don’t even know how that technology works but that’s beyond the point. Basically, Earth really needs you, SO DON’T SCREW THIS UP! To break it down, we need you to select a ship that best suits your needs, head out into space and travel to Mars and eliminate any Martian ships that you see along the way, also be careful of any asteroids that may come your way. Kill enough Martian ships and we will provide you with upgrades along the way to help in your journey, once you land on mars, eliminate any Martians that stand in your way, locate and eliminate their leader Marty the Martian and return home.
